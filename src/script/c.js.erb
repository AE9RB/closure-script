# This template demonstrates how to get at the compiler log.
# You will see the log on the browser console any time the
# compiler is run and there is an error or warning.
# Use `--summary_detail_level 3` if you want to see a log
# on all successful compilations (no errors or warnings).
# If the js_output_file didn't need an update, a cachable file
# response is used insetad.
# This is just an example to get you started. There are certainly
# more elegant ways to display a log and you could easily save
# it to the filesystem if you wanted to show it every time.

  --summary_detail_level 3
