Closure Script uses an unmodified version of BeanShell.
The BeanShell jar isn't distributed with a license.
The source code didn't have a license in it either.

So I went to their website and grabbed the license info.

Dual Licensing: Sun Public License / Gnu Lesser Public License
BeanShell is dual licensed under both the SPL and LGPL.
You may use and develop BeanShell under either license.
