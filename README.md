Googlyscript - An experience with Google Closure.

* Every Google Closure compiler option is supported.
* Easy to install rack middleware. Works in frameworks or stand-alone.
* Multithreaded-safe with a high-performance caching strategy.
* On-the-fly deps.js generation with source change detection.
* Compiler checks File.mtime and won't run if you haven't modified source.
* Java REPL so you only pay the Java startup cost once.
* Server-side templates.  ERB and Haml or add your own.
* Sass-compatible.  Use Googly::Sass not Sass::Plugin::Rack.
* Soy (coming soon)
